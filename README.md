# CSS Pseudo-element content:url() with incorrect URL

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug related to using the `content: url()` property with pseudo-elements (:before or :after).  If the specified URL is incorrect or the resource is unavailable, the pseudo-element may not render correctly, potentially leading to unexpected visual results or console errors that can easily be missed.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected version.

**Bug:** Using an incorrect or broken URL within the `content: url()` property of a pseudo-element selector can lead to unexpected display issues or silent failures, making it hard to debug.

**Solution:** Verify the URL provided within the `content: url()` property to ensure that it is accurate and points to a valid and accessible resource.
